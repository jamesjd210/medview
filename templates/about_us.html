    <p>
        We are a group of passionate students that attend the University of Texas at Austin. 
        Amidst the COVID crisis, we saw the opportunity to create a web app that could help people 
        identify where they could get the optimal healthcare. As a young group of ambitious computer 
        scientists, we are striving to create a lasting impression on the world, and MedView is one 
        of the integral stepping stones to our learning and development. Please share this application 
        with close friends and family and thank you for checking out MedView.
